## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Laptop Price Predictor** application! This Streamlit-based app is designed to predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications. Whether you are comparing laptops for purchase or simply exploring the market trends, this tool provides quick and reliable price estimations.

## Features

### üí° Key Functionalities:
1. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), the app provides an intuitive interface for entering laptop specifications.
2. **Laptop Specifications Input**:
   - Select or enter specifications like brand, processor, RAM size, storage type, screen size, GPU, and more.
3. **Price Prediction**:
   - Predicts the laptop price using a trained machine learning model.
4. **Real-Time Deployment**:
   - Accessible online, no setup required on the user‚Äôs end.
5. **Visual Insights**:
   - Displays how each specification influences the predicted price.

## Dataset

The prediction model is trained using a curated dataset containing laptop specifications and prices. The dataset includes features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, GPU, and screen size, which are critical for accurate price prediction.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Extracted relevant features (brand, processor, RAM, storage, etc.) from the dataset.
   - Cleaned and transformed the data for compatibility with the machine learning model.
2. **Model Building**:
   - Created a regression model using algorithms from `scikit-learn` to predict continuous price values.
   - Serialized the trained model and other required data into `.pkl` files for efficient loading during app usage.
3. **Interactive Application**:
   - Streamlit serves as the frontend interface, where users can input laptop specifications and view predicted prices.
